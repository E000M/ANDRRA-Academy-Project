# ANDRRA Academy Trainee Project

## Overview
This project was developed during my training program with ANDRRA Academy. The website was created using WordPress and is designed to showcase the offerings of ANDRRA Academy. The project was built locally using XAMPP (localhost environment) and has not been published to a live server yet.

## Important Notice
The website URL is currently inactive because the project was developed locally using WordPress on XAMPP (localhost environment) and has not been published to a live server.

To make the website accessible online, it would need to be hosted through a purchased hosting service.
